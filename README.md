## Setup Instructions

To ensure consistency in our analysis environment, please follow these steps to set up a Python virtual environment using **Python 3.10**.

### Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Run the following command in your terminal to create a virtual environment named `renewable_env`:
```bash
py -3.10 -m venv renewable_env
```

### Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment based on your operating system:

- **Linux/macOS:**
  ```bash
  source renewable_env/bin/activate
  ```

- **Windows (PowerShell):**
  ```bash
  .\renewable_env\Scripts\activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install Required Packages
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Start Exploring
You are now ready to begin your data analysis! Please create a new `.ipynb` file for exploratory purposes and start your analysis.

### Note:
Ensure you always activate the virtual environment before running any analysis scripts to maintain the correct dependencies.
